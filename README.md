# shortcuts-for-linguists
These scripts can be run through the program AutoHotKey (AHK) which can be installed for free. They contain helpful keyboard shortcuts for phonetics/phonology.

Please feel free to modify this script as needed! As an example:

:*?:b++::ʙ

can be interpreted the following way: change "b++" to "ʙ" immediately on typing. If you have any suggestions of other symbols to add, or more intuitive shortcuts/aliases,
please reach out to me!
